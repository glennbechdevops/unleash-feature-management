Welcome to this lab exercise where we will explore feature management using Unleash.

## Overview

In this lab we will 

* Use the Unleash UI to create a feature toggle 
* Use AWS Cloud 9 a Web based development environment to build and run an AWS lamba function
* See how we can switch on- or off a toggle and get different responses
